# Enhanced Logging for Admin Login Debugging

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `src/middlewares/admin-login-logger.js`
A comprehensive logging middleware that logs:
- **Request headers** (including IP, Origin, Referer)
- **Request body** (email and password presence, masked)
- **User lookup** (checks if user exists before authentication)
- **User status** (active, blocked, creation date)
- **Response status and headers**
- **Response body** (with tokens masked for security)
- **Authentication result** (success/failure)

### 2. Enhanced Logger Configuration
Updated `config/middlewares.js` to:
- Enable debug level logging ‚úì (already set)
- Expose logger in context for other middlewares
- Enable request logging

## How to Use

### Step 1: Deploy the Changes

```bash
git add src/middlewares/admin-login-logger.js config/middlewares.js
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive admin login logging"
git push
```

Then redeploy in Coolify.

### Step 2: Check Logs During Login Attempt

After deployment, when you attempt to login, check the Strapi logs in Coolify. You'll see detailed output like:

```
================================================================================
[req-1234567890-abc123] üîê ADMIN LOGIN ATTEMPT - 2025-10-29T19:30:00.000Z
================================================================================
[req-1234567890-abc123] Request Headers:
[req-1234567890-abc123]   content-type: application/json
[req-1234567890-abc123]   origin: https://strapi.inpublic.es
...
[req-1234567890-abc123] Request Body:
[req-1234567890-abc123]   email: itzdrugz@gmail.com
[req-1234567890-abc123]   password: ***PROVIDED*** (length: 18)
[req-1234567890-abc123] Client IP: 192.168.1.1
[req-1234567890-abc123] ‚úÖ User found in database:
[req-1234567890-abc123]   - ID: 1
[req-1234567890-abc123]   - Email: itzdrugz@gmail.com
[req-1234567890-abc123]   - Active: true
[req-1234567890-abc123]   - Blocked: false
...
[req-1234567890-abc123] Response Status: 400
[req-1234567890-abc123] ‚ùå LOGIN FAILED - Status: 400
[req-1234567890-abc123] Error: {"status":400,"name":"ApplicationError","message":"Invalid credentials"}
```

### Step 3: Analyze the Logs

Look for these key indicators:

1. **User Not Found**
   - If you see "‚ùå USER NOT FOUND", the email doesn't exist
   - The log will show all available users

2. **User Blocked/Inactive**
   - If you see "‚ùå USER IS BLOCKED" or "‚ùå USER IS INACTIVE", that's the issue
   - Fix in database or via console

3. **Password Issues**
   - Check if password is provided (length shown)
   - Check if password field is empty or missing

4. **Request Body Issues**
   - If you see "‚ö†Ô∏è Request body is empty or not parsed!", the JSON isn't being parsed correctly

5. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Check for database errors in the logs

## What to Look For

### Normal Successful Login:
```
[req-xxx] ‚úÖ User found in database
[req-xxx]   - Active: true
[req-xxx]   - Blocked: false
[req-xxx] Response Status: 200
[req-xxx] ‚úÖ LOGIN SUCCESS
```

### User Not Found:
```
[req-xxx] ‚ùå USER NOT FOUND in database for email: itzdrugz@gmail.com
[req-xxx] Found X admin user(s) in database:
[req-xxx]   1. other@email.com (Active: true, Blocked: false)
```

### User Blocked:
```
[req-xxx] ‚úÖ User found in database
[req-xxx]   - Blocked: true
[req-xxx] ‚ùå USER IS BLOCKED - Login will fail!
```

### Password Verification Failure:
```
[req-xxx] ‚úÖ User found in database
[req-xxx]   - Active: true
[req-xxx]   - Blocked: false
[req-xxx] Response Status: 400
[req-xxx] ‚ùå LOGIN FAILED
[req-xxx] Error: {"message":"Invalid credentials"}
```
(This means password hash doesn't match - need to reset password)

## Additional Debugging

### Enable Even More Verbose Logging

If you need even more details, you can temporarily modify the logger level in `config/middlewares.js`:

```javascript
{
  name: 'strapi::logger',
  config: {
    level: 'silly', // Most verbose level
    exposeInContext: true,
    requests: true,
  },
},
```

### Check Strapi Internal Logs

Strapi might also log authentication attempts internally. Look for:
- `Authentication` related logs
- `JWT` related logs  
- `Password` related logs
- `Session` related logs

### Test with curl and Watch Logs

1. Open Coolify logs viewer in one terminal/tab
2. Run curl command in another:
```bash
curl.exe -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"itzdrugz@gmail.com","password":"StrongPassword123!"}' https://strapi.inpublic.es/admin/login
```
3. Watch the logs in real-time to see exactly what happens

## Security Note

The logging middleware:
- ‚úÖ Masks passwords in logs (only shows length)
- ‚úÖ Masks tokens in response bodies
- ‚úÖ Only logs admin login endpoints (not other auth endpoints)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Logs email addresses (necessary for debugging)

For production, consider disabling or reducing logging after debugging is complete.
